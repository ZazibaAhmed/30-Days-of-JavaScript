    // Let's say we have an array

    console.log(players);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const teams1 = players;
    console.log(teams1);
   

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const teams2 = players.splice();
    teams2[3] = 'Lux2';
    console.log(teams2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const teams3 = [].concat(players);
    teams3[3] = 'Lux3';
    console.log(teams3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const teams4 = [...players];
    teams4[3] = 'Lux4';
    console.log(teams4);

    const teams5 = Array.from(players);
    teams5[3] = 'Lux5';
    console.log(teams5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign( {}, person, {number : 99, age: 44});
    console.log(cap2); 
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
